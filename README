SUMMARY

This project is an example of using a hash table to store real-world
values, in this case a dictionary of words.

The idea is to study the effect of the "loading factor" of a hash table
on it's performance. This loading factor is defined to be the number
of items in the table divided by the size of the table.

To do this, we will use the same two dictionary files on tables of size
7037, 10039, and 50023.
